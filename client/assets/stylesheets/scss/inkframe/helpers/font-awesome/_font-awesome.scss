// inkFrame note: Font Awesome classes have been disabled; only its mixins and variables can be used.
// We should define font icons in the CSS (using :before pseudo-elements), not in the HTML, because they are
// decorative elements. This also makes it easier to switch icon fonts (because only the CSS needs to be changed) if
// necessary, and we won't have to change the HTML (potentially in many places) when creating a new theme that uses
// icons differently from the previous one.
